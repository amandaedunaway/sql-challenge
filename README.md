# sql-challenge
Module 9 Challenge

### Submission Info
This is my second submission for this assignment. I added an ERD and updated the table schema so that the files import properly.

### Repo description
The data folder contains six csv files of company employee data, such as name, identifier, position, salary, and hire date, from the 1980s and 1990s. The table_squemata.sql file creates a table schema for the six csv files, which are then imported into the database. The queries.sql file then returns specific information from the database as outlined by the company's questions.

### Resources
For this assignment, I worked with Ben Comfort on the data analytics section during an in-class breakout room. For the second submission, I received help from Sibusiso during tutoring for the ERD and table schema.
